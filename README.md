# Uniprot App Readme

## Overview

The Uniprot App is a simple web application that allows users to retrieve information about proteins using their Uniprot Accession Number. It uses the Uniprot API to fetch data and display it in a user-friendly format on the web page. This README file provides an overview of the app's structure, functionality, and how to set it up and use it.
